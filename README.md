This project is a simple todo app built using React, Redux, and Redux Toolkit.

## Steps to create:

3. Define the Redux logic:
   a. Create a slice for todos that includes reducers to add, toggle, and remove todos.
   b. Configure the Redux store to use the todo slice.
4. Build the UI components:

   b. Display the list of todos.
   c. Add interactivity: toggle todos as completed, and remove todos.
5. Integrate the Redux store with the React app using the Provider component.

## Running the app:
